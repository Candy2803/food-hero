     Fighting Hunger, One Meal at a Time
==================================================

ABOUT THE PROJECT
------------------
Food Hero is a web-based platform built to reduce food waste and fight hunger.
It connects restaurants and food providers with nearby shelters and individuals
experiencing homelessness by coordinating the collection and delivery of safe,
leftover food.

Instead of discarding excess food at the end of the day, restaurants and food
vendors can easily schedule pickups. Volunteers or partnered delivery services
help transport the food to shelters or distribute it directly to people in need.

Food Hero exists to create a bridge between abundance and scarcity â€” ensuring
that no good food goes to waste, and no human goes hungry when we can help it.
