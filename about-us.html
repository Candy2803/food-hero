            <p>
              Food Heroes was launched on July 12, 2025, during a local
              hackathon where a team of passionate problem-solvers came together
              with one goal: to stop food waste and feed more people. What began
              as a 24-hour challenge quickly turned into a real-world mission.
              With a simple idea and a powerful platform, Food Heroes connects
              surplus food from homes, restaurants, and events to those who need
              it most. Built in a day—made to make a difference every day.

            <h3 class="major">The Daily Waste We Can’t Afford</h3>
            <p>
              Every day, restaurants around the world throw away tons of
              perfectly edible food. In fact, it's estimated that the food
              service industry wastes up to 11.4 million tons of food each
              year—translating to thousands of tons every single day. From
              unsold meals and overstocked ingredients to plate waste, much of
              this food ends up in landfills, contributing to both environmental
              harm and missed opportunities to feed those in need. Reducing this
              waste isn’t just about saving food—it’s about creating a more
              sustainable and compassionate system for everyone.
            </p>

            <p>
              Every plate of food that goes uneaten in a restaurant represents
              more than just lost money—it’s lost resources, energy, and the
              chance to feed someone in need. Across the globe, restaurants
              waste an enormous amount of food each day, often due to
              over-preparation, oversized portions, or strict food safety
              regulations. While some waste is unavoidable, much of it is
              perfectly edible and could be redirected to people instead of
              trash bins. Addressing this daily waste isn’t just a business
              issue—it’s a social and environmental responsibility.
            </p>
